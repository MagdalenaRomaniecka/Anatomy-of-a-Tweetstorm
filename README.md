### Project Goal
This project's goal was to move beyond static frequency analysis and investigate the **dynamics of Elon Musk's communication over time**. Key objectives included:
- Programmatically loading and cleaning a large, raw dataset of tweets.
- **Engineering a new feature** by extracting and converting publication dates.
- Identifying trends in the usage of key phrases over the years.
- **Connecting observed data trends with real-world events** using **Deep Research** to answer not just "what?" but, more importantly, "why?".

### Data Processing Workflow

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline, transforming raw, messy data into a clean, analysis-ready format. The process shows how the first file (raw data) is used to create the second file (processed data).

**1. Data Input (The First File):**
The process starts with the raw dataset sourced from Kaggle, named `all_musk_posts.csv`. This file contains over 50,000 tweets with multiple columns, where the relevant data (date and text) is unstructured.

**2. Cleaning & Transformation (Python Script):**
A Python script in a Google Colab notebook performs the following key operations:
- **Loads the raw CSV** into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Parses the `createdAt` column**, converting it from a string to a proper datetime object for time-series analysis.
- **Iterates through each tweet's text** in the `fullText` column.
- **Searches for predefined keywords** (e.g., 'tesla', 'legacy media') within the text.

**3. Data Output (The Second File):**
The script generates a new, clean, and structured dataset named `analysis_ready_tweets.csv`. This file contains only the tweets that matched our keywords and is structured with three clear columns: `Date`, `Tweet_Text`, and `Found_Term`. This processed file is the direct input for the final analysis and visualization stage.
